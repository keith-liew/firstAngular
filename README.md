Hi. Welcome to my first Angular project.

This is my first project that is required me to learn both version control system (git) and a new platform (Angular)

This project comes with simple CRUD function.

The project is built to request httpclient request to a rest api (https://gorest.co.in/)

Due to insufficient time of learning and developing the projectm, the project only able to finish the user module that show the CRUD function.





# FirstAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
